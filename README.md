# whisper-demo

This is a speech perception experiment which was run on Amazon Mechanical Turk December 2017. The results of the experiment were presented at the 2018 Linguistic Society of America meeting in Salt Lake City.

The experiment is presented in HTML and JavaScript. 

It presents listeners with synthesized whispers and asks them to match the whisper to a synthesized modally phonated voice. 

This code was written by graduate student Emily Remirez and faculty advisor Prof Susan Lin, UC Berkeley Department of Linguistics. Some parts of it were modified from code written by Morris Alper.
