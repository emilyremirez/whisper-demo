# whisper-demo

This is a speech perception experiment which was run on Amazon Mechanical Turk December 2017. The results of the experiment were presented at the 2018 Linguistic Society of America meeting in Salt Lake City.

The experiment is presented in HTML and JavaScript. 

It presents listeners with synthesized whispers and asks them to match the whisper to a synthesized modally phonated voice.
